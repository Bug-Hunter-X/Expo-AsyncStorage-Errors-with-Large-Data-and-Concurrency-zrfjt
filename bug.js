This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in Expo with a large amount of data.  The error message may vary, but it generally indicates that AsyncStorage has reached its storage limit or that a transaction has timed out.  It frequently manifests when attempting to store an object larger than the AsyncStorage limit, or in situations with many simultaneous storage operations.  The application will likely freeze or crash.
